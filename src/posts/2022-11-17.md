>>> TURBOPACK (alpha)

Thank you for trying Next.js v13 with Turbopack! As a reminder,
Turbopack is currently in alpha and not yet ready for production.
We appreciate your ongoing support as we work to make it ready
for everyone.

Error: You are using configuration and/or tools that are not yet
supported by Next.js v13 with Turbopack:

- Babel detected (.babelrc)
  Babel is not yet supported. To use Turbopack at the moment,
  you'll need to remove your usage of Babel.

- Unsupported Next.js configuration option(s) (next.config.js)
  The only configurations options supported are:
    - experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages
    - experimental.transpilePackages
  To use Turbopack, remove other configuration options.

If you cannot make the changes above, but still want to try out
Next.js v13 with Turbopack, create the Next.js v13 playground app
by running the following commands:

  yarn create next-app --example with-turbopack with-turbopack-app
  cd with-turbopack-app
  yarn run dev
